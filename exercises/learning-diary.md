# Learning Diary

Keeping a learning diary will guide you to:

1. _Reflect_ and _self-evaluate_ your own _studying and learning processes_.
2. Help you in _developing your studying skills_.

In addition, your teachers will get useful information for running the current course implementation and for the further development of the course.

_The completion of a proper learning diary is mandatory_ (no diary, no passing grade) and it is included in your activity points in course assessment. Deadlines must be observed carefully. Learning diaries are 100% confidential. Please feel free to ask your teacher for more advice.

## How to submit your diary

Please submit each part of your diary (parts 1 and 2) as a separate Word or PDF document to Moodle. The submission is on the Moodle's "Learning diary" page.

> [!NOTE]
> You should follow the [Haaga-Helia Reporting Guidelines](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/guidelines-writing-reports) and use the assignments format in your learning diary.

## Part 1

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deadline for part 1 is before the second course week's class.

First, describe:

- Your starting level on this subject
- Your own aims and objectives
- Are there any known obstacles in your way?

Then, answer the following questions:

> [!NOTE]
> You'll find the answers in the first week's lesson slides on the Moodle's "Course outline" page and the "Study Instructions" section on the "General" page.

1. How should you confirm your participation in the Data Management and Databases course?
2. What are the minimum requirements for passing the course?
3. Where do you find the weekly learning materials and exercises?
4. Explain in your own words what do the "Study Instructions" section on the Moodle's "General" page say about using AI in this course?

## Part 2

Add content to your learning diary based on the following questions:

1. Considering the first part of the course:
   - How did I study?
   - What was difficult? What was easy?
   - What helped me to learn? Was there something that made my learning more difficult?
   - How did I manage to remove obstacles to reaching my goals?
   - How much time did I spend in self-studying and completing the homework assignments?
2. What information sources have I been using (course material, websites etc.)?
3. What kinds of studying techniques have I been using on this course so far?
4. How active were my learning efforts on the first part of the course? Is there room for any improvement? Would I do something differently if I could start the course again?

## Part 3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deadline for part 3 is before the last week of the course starts.

Add content to your learning diary based on the following questions:

1. First, briefly discuss the second part of the course. The questions are the same as in the second part of the learning diary assignment.

Then, discuss the following items:

2. Estimate your knowledge and skills on the subject at the end of the course. Do they meet your expectations? If not, why?
3. Would you do something differently if you could take the course again?
