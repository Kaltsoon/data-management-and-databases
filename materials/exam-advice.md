# Exam advice

This advice will prepare you for the mid-term and final exams.

## Mid-term exam

- Mid-term exam will **only contain tasks related to SQL queries**, so every answer of the exam task will start with a `SELECT` statement
- You will be presented with a database consisting of 3-4 tables with some example data for each table
- You will receive a copy of the SQL DML Quick Reference in the exam
- In the tasks, you will need to be able to write a SQL query that solves the specified query problem, e.g. _"Write a query that displays the movie with the most Oscar awards (movie name, director name, oscar awards)"_
- You will definitely need the following SQL topics in the questions:
  - Join operations (`INNER JOIN` and `LEFT OUTER JOIN` operations)
  - Aggregate functions (e.g. `SUM`, `COUNT`, or `MAX` functions)
  - Grouping (`GROUP BY` clause)
  - Subqueries ([IN and NOT IN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp) operators in subqueries might become useful)
- Recap by redoing some of the SQL assignments (especially related to the topics above) and comparing your solutions to the model solutions     
- The exam has 7 questions and two bonus questions for additional points

## Final exam

- It is guaranteed that the final exam **will include the following types of tasks**:
  - Practical tasks (solving a problem)
    - ER diagramming (create an ER diagram based on the given text)
    - Normalisation (show the FDs, determine the normal form, decompose the relation). This includes a solid understanding of superkeys, candidate keys, primary keys, alternate keys, and composite keys
  - Theory-related tasks (e.g. _"What is the purpose of X"_)
    - Terminology task (explain in your own words a couple of terms) and/or a question related to the theory
    - One theory-related task will be related to database transactions (doesn't require knowing any transaction-related SQL syntax)
- It is guaranteed that the final exam **won't include the following**:
  - **Writing any SQL**, e.g. related to database transactions
  - Questions about SQL Server -specific details or SQL Server Management Studio
  - Anything that is not covered by the course handouts and assignments
- Recap the following topics (see the learning objectives on the first slide of the lesson slides):
  - Introduction to Databases (focus on the learning objectives)
  - The Relational Model (very important, some terminology needed in the exam)
  - Conceptual Database Design (there will be a practical task on ER diagramming)
  - Logical Database Design (the learning objectives guide you here)
  - Database Normalisation (there will be a practical task on normalisation)
  - Physical Database Design (focus on integrity constraints and indexes)
  - Database Transactions (the basic concepts, concurrency control)
- The exam has 5 questions and two bonus questions for additional points
